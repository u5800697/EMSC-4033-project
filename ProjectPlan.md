## Historic bushfire analysis tool

## Executive summary

In one to two sentences, explain the background, the broad goals of the project and what the specific outcomes will be.

I want to find out the amount of severe bushfire events australia has had in the past, I want to do this with pixels showing different amounts. For example, for a single fire show green, and multiple fires shoes darker pixel colours. I want this to be a relativly freeform program so that people can use it. Maybe divide the landscape by what data is avaliable. Once setup people can select the years that the data is viewed. So that if they want a single year data they can get a  single year, and if they wat all data since a certain year i.e. 1950 - 2020, they can see all burned areas and how often they have burned


## Goals

- to create a tool capable of analysing histroic earthquakes and produce a easily readable map that anyone can use
- Get an at a glance view of where bushfires are common to have occured historically
- ...

(Write things that you can assess whether they have been accomplished. For example, a goal like “improve visualisation of ocean output” is vague... But a goal that reads “implement functionality to plot streamlines of horizontal velocities in various slices from 3D ocean output” is specific enough.)

## Background and Innovation  

_Give more details on the scientific problem that you are working on and how this project will advance the discipline or help with your own research.
(Where applicable, describe how people have been achieving this goal up to now, talk about existing packages, their limitations, whether you can generalise something to help other people use your code)._

## Resources & Timeline

_What do you have at your disposal already that will help the project along. Did you convince somebody else to help you ? Are there already some packages you can build upon. What makes it possible to do this project in the time available. Do you intend to continue this project in the future ?_

(For example:
  - I’ll be using data of X from satellite and then also data from baby blue seals…
  - I’ll step on existing package Y and build extra functionality on top of class W.
  - I’ll use textbook Z that describes algorithms a, b, c
  - …
)

## Testing, validation, documentation

**Note:** You need to think about how you will know your code is correct and achieves the goals that are set out above (specific tests that can be implemented automatically using, for example, the `assert` statement in python.)  It can be really helpful if those tests are also part of the documentation so that when you tell people how to do something with the code, the example you give is specifically targetted by some test code.

_Provide some specific tests with values that you can imagine `assert`ing_
