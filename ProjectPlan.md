## Historic bushfire analysis tool

## Executive summary

I want to find out the amount of severe bushfire events australia has had in the past, I want to do this with pixels showing different amounts of fires. For example, for a single fire show green, and multiple fires shoes darker pixel colours. I want this to be a relativly freeform program so that people can use it. Maybe divide the landscape by what data is avaliable. Once setup people can select the years that the data is viewed. So that if they want a single year data they can get a  single year, and if they wat all data since a certain year i.e. 1950 - 2020, they can see all burned areas and how often they have burned. This has been done before, so i want the public to compare multiple different sources together so that they can overlay drought related data and average precipitation.


## Goals

From most to least important 

- to create a tool capable of analysing histroic earthquakes and produce a easily readable map that anyone can use
- Get an at a glance view of where bushfires are common to have occured historically
- compare this to data from precipitation and drought data 
- make it easy to use

## Background and Innovation  

existing packages already exist. https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/b7c3dd632a174d239bf72fa20226ca96 has 100 years of bushfire data, I will be using the same resources that they used. Next BOM houses annual precipitation and drought data, this will thus be used as a comparison to my existing data.

## Resources & Timeline

Build a simple tool, use ARCGIS as basic package. Build up map, and let person input year - phase 1
add bom data of rainfall - phase 2
add compare and contrast charts- phase 3
make the package accessable to user - phase 4
